    <p> This is simply dummy text of the <span class="my-style">printing and typesetting</span> industry. Lorem Ipsum
        has been the
        industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled
        it to make a type
        specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
        essentially unchanged. </p>
